## Description
This is a minimal package for a pure Julia implementation of tools used in [Computability Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability_theory).  This is the science involving mathematical models of what it means to compute.  This naturally progresses to the idea of complexity: how much memory is used in computing?  How long will it take?  Does it halt?
